            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Firſt, what truths come under the cognizance of the Scriptures, and theſe are all ſaving truths; to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them from naturall, civill, and morall truths, whereof the Scripture takes ſmall notice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they make a man wiſe onely to the world, and not (as the Scriptures do) wiſe to ſalvation: yea<note place="margin">2 Ti. 3. 15.</note> and from ſome divine truths too, for all truths in divinity are not ſaving truths; of which ſort are many hiſtoricall, ethicall, eccleſiaſticall, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematicall truths, that ſerve rather to puffe up the head with knowledge then to edify the heart with charity. Now theſe &amp; ſuch like are <hi>vera, ſed libere credenda,</hi> Truths indeed, but ſuch as we have a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in, either to believe or not, without laying our
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:120107:15"/>
ſalvation to ſtake upon them. But as for Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall truths, that ſerve as well to reform our lives as to inform our underſtandings, theſe onely are <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſario credenda ad ſalutem,</hi> neceſſarily to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to ſalvation, and ſo become ſaving truths, at leaſt in their funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls, whereby<note place="margin">Fundamentals muſt be believed with a faith explicit, abſolute and divine. <hi>Baxt. Saints reſt part 2. pag.</hi> 241.</note> they challenge the holy Scriptures to be their rule; as in the doctrine of the Trinity, the deity of Chriſt, and others of like ſort.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon is this, becauſe all ſuch truths are either in plain and expreſſe terms laid<note place="margin">See the 8. Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the 20. Article propoſit. 7. explained by <hi>Rogers.</hi>
               </note> down in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or elſe are naturally and by good conſequence deduced from them as their grounds, or elſe reduced to them as to their rule.</p>

(<hi>That is</hi>) There are ſome things that both are in the Scriptures, and are expreſſed there plainly in ſo many words and ſyllables: but other things that are there, though not ſo expreſſed, but onely colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from them; as that the Father is unbegotten, &amp;c. <hi>Nazianz. orat. de Spiritu Sancto, ubi plura.</hi>
               </note> of truth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Scripture is ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-truth, though not <hi>formaliter</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally (as the ſchool ſpeaks) yet <hi>redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive &amp; funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaliter,</hi> that is, as it is reduced to it, and founded on it: <hi>Chriſt</hi> being the perſonall foundation our faith muſt reſt upon, as in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinth. chap. 3. verſe 11. Other foundation can no man lay then that which is laid, even</hi> Jeſus Chriſt; but the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:120107:15"/>
Scripture the Doctrinall, as in the 2. chap. to the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> verſe 20. <hi>Ye are built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foundation of the Prophets</hi>

            <p>The ſecond is, how all ſaving truths fall under the cognizance of the Scriptures: and this is by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubjected to them as to their rule. Whereby Rule I do not mean ſo much the materiall book wherein they are written, as the formall truth, which is the will of God revealed in them; as when we ſpeak of a rule, we intend not ſo much the materiall wood, as the formall meaſure. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> in two ſeverall places calls it ſo in expreſs words: as in the 3. chap. <hi>Philip.</hi> verſe 16.<note place="margin">

            <p>Now a Rule hath four properties, all which are agreeable to the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Firſt, a rule hath a kind of authority over the things that are laid to it, to be tri'd and examin'd by

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, a rule muſt be ſtrait and right: and ſo is the Scripture, a right word, (as <hi>David</hi> calles it;)<note place="margin">Pſal. 33. 4. Eccleſiaſtes chap. 12. verſe 10.</note> and the Preacher ſayes to the ſame effect, that <hi>what was written was upright,</hi> or, as <hi>Tremelius</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates it by the Hebrew, <hi>Scriptum rectitudine verba veritatis.</hi> It is not like that <hi>Lesbian</hi> rule which<note place="margin">Regula non quam formoſa, ſed quam recta ſit quaritur. <hi>Sen.</hi> Epiſtol. 76.</note> would bend any way: no, it inclines neither

too much on the right hand, nor yet on the left, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to maintain ſuperſtition on the one hand, or profaneneſſe on the other.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a rule is perfect, at leaſt <hi>in ſuo genere,</hi> and in relation to the things that are to be perfected by it; it being impoſſible to perfect any thing by an imperfect rule. And ſuch alſo is the holy Scripture, a perfect rule in order to ſaving and converting truths: which made the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſay, That <hi>the law of</hi>

               </gap>s alſo?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A rule muſt be known: for though<note place="margin">

                  </gap>ce verſa,</hi> the foundation upon the building.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by telling us, That the Doctrine of the Church (meaning that of the <hi>Romane</hi> Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch) muſt rule us, though yet they will not rectifie it by the rule of Gods word; whereas particular Churches may and do often erre (as <hi>Rome</hi> now doth) from the right way of truth, becauſe Gods promiſe of ſending<note place="margin">Iohn 14. 13</note> his holy Spirit to lead into all truth, was not made to any particular, but onely to the Catholick Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rch.<note place="margin">See <hi>Carlton</hi>'s Directions to know the true Church, <hi>pag.</hi> 48.</note> And therefore when they cry out to us ſo much, that their Doctrine muſt rule us, (methinks) it would do well, if withall they would let us know what
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:120107:18"/>
rule ſhould rule their Doctrine; which is this rule of truth here ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By making unwritten truths (as they call Traditions) a part of this rule, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth, whoſe words are theſe; I ſay that the Scripture is not the totall, but the partiall rule of<note place="margin">Totalis enim regula eſt verbum Dei, ſive revelatio Dei Eccleſiae facta, quae dividitur in duas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulas partiales<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Scripturam &amp; traditiones. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> lib. 4. de Verbo Dei non ſcripto, cap. 12.</note> faith. Whereas if the Scripture rule (as it is) be perfect, then is there no need of their traditions, which have onely a pretended O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall<note place="margin">De hoc lege 6. q. clar.

            <p>Fourthly, by denying the reading of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to the people in a tongue they underſtand; whereas no man can<note place="margin">Qui dat operam veritati, venit ad lucem, ut opera ejus ſint ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſta. <hi>Iohn 3. 21.</hi>
               </note> walk by a rule that is either not known to him, or elſe hid from him: Truth being like<note place="margin">Non amat veritas angulos, ſed in medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>2. The Scriptures are called the word of truth <hi>Efficienter,</hi> from the efficient cauſe, or authour of them; and this is God, who is eſſentially true: ſo ſayes the Spirit, <hi>Rev. 3. 7. Theſe things ſayes he who is holy and true.</hi> For which cauſe it is called the breath of God, as in the 2. Epiſt. to <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. chap.<note place="margin">

is inſpired or breath'd of God; even as the ſoul is ſaid to be breath'd into the body, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. to ſhew its immediate Originall from God the father of ſpirits.</p>

            <p>The Apoſtle in the ſecond Epiſt. to the <hi>Theſſal.</hi> chap. 2. verſe 11. ſpeaks of ſome upon whom God would ſend ſtrong deluſions, and infatuate ſo far in their pertinacie to errour, as that they ſhould believe a lie: and doth he not hereby ſeem to point at the <hi>Romane</hi> Church?

            <p>The 1. means I ſhall commend unto you for the<note place="margin">1 Means.</note> extracting of ſaving truth out of the Scriptures is, the conſtant reading of them.

            <p>The 2. means to extract ſaving truth out of the<note place="margin">2.

            <p>Now this, as it is a principall means of beating out truth in naturall and morall things, ſo alſo do we allow it for a ſubordinate means in things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Theologicall; for<note place="margin">

            <p>And therefore though we do not adore it ſo much as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do, yet do we not on the other ſide altogether ſlight it and lay it by, ſince the Apoſtle<note place="margin">Rom. 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, the reaſonable as well as the religious ſervice which God accepts. For wherefore hath God made us rationall creatures, and given us the talent of reaſon, but to make uſe of it to his glory, and our beſt advantage? reaſon making up the beſt<note place="margin">Optimum in homine ratio eſt: Mac antecedit animalia, Deum ſequitur.

            <p>2. Our own reaſon will help us to find out ſaving truth in the Scriptures <hi>per modum Diſpoſitionis,</hi> by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:120107:31"/>
way of diſpoſing thoſe things we conceive for truth in the Scripture to the main end they were ordered and appointed to. It is ſo in naturall and morall things, as well as divine. And here take this ſhort, and eaſy rule. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Doctrine which diſpoſes moſt to the glory of God, as in<note place="margin">

            <p>Now then, if we conſider which Doctrines, either the <hi>Romiſh</hi> or ours, doe this, then that will be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yielded for the truth of<note place="margin">Tutiores vivimus, ſi to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Deo damus, non au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem nos illi ex parte, &amp; ex parte nobis commi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Without queſtion, there is no doctrine conducing ſo much to this end, as the doctrine of our Reformed Religion; and therefore this, and not Popery, muſt needs be the truth of God held out unto us in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Per modum Illationis,</hi> by way of inference;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:120107:31"/>
and ſo our reaſon will help us to draw and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude divine truths from Scripture grounds. As when we read <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. of Chriſt, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens muſt receive him till the reſtitution of all things; here my reaſon will come in and conclude thus much from it, That then the body of Chriſt cannot be carnally in the Euchariſt; becauſe it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſon to imagine a true body, whoſe inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable property is to be circumſcribed in one place, yet to be at once in two ſeverall places, as in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and at the Lords table.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Per modum Collationis,</hi> by way of compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and that two wayes.</p>
            <p>1. By comparing the doctrines collected out of the Scriptures with themſelves, that ſo we may ſee by their agreement one with another whether they be true or no: for reaſon will tell us, that not only in naturall and morall, but alſo in divine things there is no ſurer index of falſhood then contrariety, and of truth then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent<note place="margin">Veritas Dei una, ſemperque ſui ſimilis.

            <p>And by this I would fain know how the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſts humanity can ſtand well with the doctrine of Ubiquity, the laſt of theſe pretending to

            <p>Now the word preached in the mouth of Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters is a good means to extract ſaving truth out of the Scriptures two wayes. 1. By way of diſcovery. 2. By way of application.</p>
            <p>1. By way of diſcovery; whereby the ſhell is broken that ſo we may come to the kernell, and the letter of the Scripture opened, that ſo we may ſee the truth that lies hid under it. And thus the <hi>Levites</hi> are ſaid to <hi>read the law diſtinctly,</hi> to <hi>give the ſenſe, and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Neh. 8. 8.</note> 
               <hi>cauſe</hi> the people <hi>to understand the reading.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. By way of application, by applying the truth diſcovered to our own uſe and practiſe; for elſe, though the word preached may be a truth in it ſelf, yet is it not ſo to me, till it be made mine own by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. The word of God therefore is called a rule: now there can be no right and orderly building up of the Church without application of the rule unto it.</p>
            <p>The fourth is meditation of what we have read<note place="margin">4 Means.</note>

            <p>Nor is it onely as a ſeale to imprint it, but alſo as a witneſſe to atteſt it: ſo ſayes S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> The ſpirit<note place="margin">1 Iohn 5. 6.</note> beares witneſſe, becauſe the ſpirit is truth, (that is) becauſe the Doctrine delivered by the ſpirit (which is there called the Spirit by way of Metonymy) is truth.</p>
            <p>Oh how ſhould the conſideration hereof prevail with us to beg every day the aſſiſtance of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpirit! And our Saviour tells us, that if we ask

his Spirit of him, he will give it: which made the<note place="margin">Luke 11. 13</note> Prophet <hi>David</hi> pray in one place, that God would<note place="margin">Pſal. 143. 10</note>

            <p>1. Becauſe we are only Leſſees to truth from our great Landlord: For Truth is not our own free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold to ſell or diſpoſe of at our pleaſures; which makes S. <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyn <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>hold faſt the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern</hi>
               <note place="margin">2Ti. 1. 13.</note> or breviary <hi>of ſound words;</hi> and one reaſon there given, is, becauſe it was <hi>committed unto</hi> him to <hi>keep by the Holy ghost:</hi> And they that are Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fees in truſt muſt be faithfull, and not embezzle what was committed to them as a <hi>Depoſitum;</hi> but keep it ſafely to themſelves,<note place="margin">Vid.

               </note> and carefully tranſmit it to poſterity. Indeed Truth is ours for the uſe and efficacy of it, but Gods for the right and title; and we muſt neither ſell, nor dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh that which is committed to our cuſtody as a matter of truſt from God, for our own good, and the good of thoſe that ſucced us both in Church and State. If we do, Oh what a ſad account ſhall we have to give unto God, when he ſhall one day ask us, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did the Biſhop of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for the young man he committed to him, <hi>Ubi depoſitum, animaſcilicet fratris?</hi> where is that I committed to thy keeping, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſoul<note place="margin">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:120107:40"/>
and loſt another by careleſneſſe; when as you have ſold away one parcell thereof for profit and preferment, and given away another by a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling apoſtancy. And yet ſuch keepers of truth we have in theſe daies too many. Our lands and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall eſtates God hath given us as moveables, and over theſe he hath empower'd us with a right of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them away to others, as may ſeem good to us; but as for his ſaving truth, this is ſomewhat of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf given out unto us, and therefore is not to be made away, but to remain as a ſtandard by us, untill the ſame hand that fixed it, do (for our unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) remove it from us to ſome other nation that ſhall make better uſe of it then we have done: which God grant may never be untill time ſhall be no more!</p>
            <p>Whatever then we part with, we muſt not part with Truth, but keep it for God our great Landlord and right owner of it: that ſo when he ſhall come to account with us, he may receive his own again with advantage, and reward us for faithfull ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards with an <hi>Euge bone ſerve, well done good and</hi>

boldly ſay, that we hold our liberties, our lifes, our livelyhoods, and all, by holding the truth of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion among us. So that, if there be none with us (which God forbid) to plead for truth, (which was the miſerable eſtate of the Iews <hi>Iſai</hi> 59. 4.) how then can we think that truth ſhould plead a word for us, when God ſhall come to judge us? Or if Truth be faln in our ſtreets, as it was in theirs, verſe 14. it cannot be then, that we ſhould ſtand long after it, no more then <hi>Troy</hi> did after the <hi>Palladium</hi> was gone. For tell me, I pray, what was the fall of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> but becauſe he abode not in the truth? or of<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 44</note> the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Church, or of the 7.

And why ſhould we think to ſpeed better then they, when we let true religion, which is the ſtay and buttreſſe of the State and Church, moulder away to nothing, and take no care at all to keep it up?</p>
            <p>The 3. reaſon why we muſt hold truth ſo faſt is,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </note> becauſe what ever becomes of men, the truth of God and his word ſhall be ſure to hold. And this S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 24, 25.

            <p>In the firſt chapter of <hi>Iſai,</hi> verſe 22. the Lord complains of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ſhe <hi>mixed</hi> his <hi>wine with water,</hi> which doth much abate the ſtrength and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie of the wine: and in the ſecond Epiſtie to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the ſecond chapter and the laſt verſe, we find the like expreſſion, where the Apoſtle ſayes of ſome that they did <hi>corrupt the word of</hi> God. Now the Greek word there uſed is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and it is a Metaphor (ſayes one) from deceitfull vintners, that<note place="margin">

And ſo there are ſome in theſe dayes who do corrupt Gods truth with the watry conceptions of their own brains; and if they can gain to themſelves this way never ſo little, they think they have done well enough, though in the mean time the truth be at a great loſſe with them in

its former ſtrength and efficacy. But as <hi>Simon Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſaid to <hi>Simon Magus, Thy mony periſh with thee:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 8. 20.</note> ſo ſay I to all ſuch, your gain periſh with you, who can ſo far abaſe your <hi>precious faith</hi> (as S. <hi>Peter</hi>

            <p>But as for us, let us beware of ſuch mixtures; and if they be offer'd to us, let us reject them: for though ſometimes we may get by them here, yet ſure I am, that we ſhall looſe hereafter; and if we gain the world, we ſhall looſe our own ſouls: and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit<note place="margin">Mark 8. 36.</note> will there be in this (ſayes our Saviour) when as that is onely true gain which will abide with us in another life?

            <p>5. and laſtly, If we would hold the truth of God faſt, we muſt watch over the flexibility of our own corrupt nature, which is very apt to wheel about to any thing which is called truth. For the world can have no ſuch power to unſettle us of truth, did not the inclination of our own ſpirits joyn iſſue with it againſt us.

            <p>1. If we love God, we muſt needs love truth, becauſe God is <hi>Summum verum</hi> as well as <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum,</hi> the higheſt truth as well as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good; which makes <hi>David</hi> call him the <hi>God of truth,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo.<note place="margin">Pſal. 31. 5. Deut. 32. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. If we love our neighbour alſo we muſt needs love truth, becauſe without truth neighbourly love and unity cannot be continued. And in this ſenſe (if there were no other) may we underſtand that of the Philoſopher, that <hi>Verum &amp; unum convertun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:120107:63"/>
that truth and unity are convertible: which made our Saviour, in that zealous prayer of his for the preſervation of his elect in unity, deſire of his father, that he would <hi>ſanctifie them through</hi> the<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 17.</note> 
               <hi>truth;</hi> and tells them further, that his <hi>word is truth.</hi> The word of truth then is a ſpeciall means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the people of God in unity: For did not the word of truth direct all the members of Chriſts my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body to act orderly in their ſeverall charges, you ſhould ſee none of them keep their proper ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but the tongue would fall out with the hand, the hand again with the foot, and all of them ſtand out againſt the command of the head, to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the whole body.</p>
            <p>3. If we love our ſelves alſo we muſt needs love truth, becauſe herein the happineſſe of the ſoul, the better part of us, conſiſts. And to this purpoſe is that ſaying of S. <hi>Auſtin, Quid aliud eſt beate vivere, quam</hi>
               <note place="margin">

For wherefore was it S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s deſire &amp; prayer for <hi>Iſrael</hi> that they might<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 1</note> be ſaved, but onely out of the overflowings of his, love to them? which if it were not highly exceſſive, you may judge by that hyperbolicall wiſh of his, verſe 3. of the 9. chapt. and the three-fold proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 1, 3.</note> he premiſes to it verſe 1. <hi>I ſay the truth in Chriſt and lie not, mine</hi> own <hi>conſcience bearing me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt;</hi> that <hi>I could wiſh my ſelf</hi> to be <hi>accurſed for my brethren</hi> and <hi>kinſmen according to the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee then, that love is an excellent Oratour, and there needs not a better key to open our hearts to God in the behalf of the truth then this. Our own keeping will not keep truth ſafe enough: No; <hi>Except</hi>

And we need not goe far for an example of it, no further then the newly-converted <hi>Romans</hi> in the Text; with whom there was a hot ſtrife about meats forbidden to be eaten by the Leviticall Law as unclean. For the ſtrong <hi>Romans</hi> were throughly perſwaded of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:120107:70"/>
their liberty in the uſe of things indifferent, and therefore did eate what was ſet before them, making<note place="margin">Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Thus were they divided in opinions; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but in affections too: for the ſtrong took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them with a great deal of liberty to deſpiſe the weak, and the weak likewiſe on the other ſide to judge and cenſure the ſtrong. The one are deſpiſed as ſimple and ignorant, the other judged as ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and uncharitable.</p>
            <p>Now S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeeing the breach ſo wide betwixt them, doth here, like a good umpire, endeavour what he can to arbitrate the matter in difference with them, and to reduce them to concord and unity. And this he doth 2. wayes.</p>
            <p>1. By diſſwading the weak from judging the ſtrong. <hi>Who art thou</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that judgeſt another mans ſervant? He ſtands and falls to his own maſter.</hi> chap. 14. verſe 4. And it is an argument drawn from common equity, which tells us that we muſt not uſurp upon anothers right. For there are 3. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives that God will not have us to entrench on.</p>
            <p>The 1. is his own glory. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42. 8.</p>
            <p>The 2. is vengeance; for <hi>vengeance is mine, I will repay, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Rom. 12. 19.</p>
            <p>The 3. is judgement; as in that place of S. <hi>Paul, He that judgeth me is the Lord.</hi> 1. Cor. 4. 4.</p>
            <p>2. By perſwading the ſtrong to bear with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the weak; as in the 1. verſe of this chap. where the word that we tranſlate <hi>bear,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: and it is a Metaphor either from Porters, who make it their livelyhood to bear other mens burdens; or elſe from Nurſes, who bear up their weaklings in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:120107:70"/>
their hands, leaſt at any time they daſh their feet againſt a ſtone.</p>
            <p>And the arguments here uſed by the Apoſtle are two.</p>
            <p>The firſt is drawn from the good of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours unto edification, verſe 2. <hi>Let every one of us pleaſe his neighbour for his good unto edification.</hi> Where the reaſon is this, That their bearing with the weak would be a means every day to build them up into a better liking and opinion of the ſtrong; for it is not the beating down of weakneſſes, but the bearing with them,<note place="margin">Nobile vincendi genus eſt patientia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Ovid.</hi>
               </note> that gains upon ingenuous natures.</p>
            <p>The 2. is taken from the example of Chriſt, verſe 3. <hi>For even Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle;) <hi>as it is written,</hi>
               <note place="margin">This is cited out of 69 Pſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verſe 9.</note> 
               <hi>The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.</hi> As if the Apoſtle had ſaid thus unto them; Even he that is infinite in ſtrength, and ſo could not have been forced to have born with any thing in his people, yet was he pleaſed notwithſtanding for their ſakes to bear their ſins, that were ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull to his father, by ſuffering the utmoſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due unto them, <hi>in his own body upon the</hi>

               <hi>tree</hi> (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks.) And this example of Chriſt (which is a perfect pattern for all morall duties) ſhould move thoſe that are ſtrongeſt among you, to bear with the weakneſſes of your brethren.</p>
            <p>And now, when he could not lay their heat this way, he then bethinks himſelf of another courſe to doe it by; and this is by prayer: That what he could not gain at their hands by reaſoning with them, he may now obtain at Gods hands by praying for them. And this he doth here in the words of the

            <p>In which benediction 3. things offer themſelves unto your conſideration.</p>
            <p>1. The duty wiſhed or prayed for in the behalf of his new Chriſtian <hi>Romans;</hi> and this is, to be like-minded one towards another, both in opinion and affection: for the word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>2. The efficient cauſe of this like mindedneſſe; and this is God: For it is<note place="margin">

               <hi>God</hi> (ſayes <hi>David</hi>) that <hi>ſets the ſolitary in families,</hi> (as it is in our new tranſlation after the Septuagint) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. verſe 6. or that makes men of one mind in an houſe, (as it is in the old;) for the Hebrew word there uſed (ſayes one)<note place="margin">

            <p>Like-mindedneſſe then is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Gods gift: therefore it runs here, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Lord give you to mind the ſame thing. That, as the Apoſtle ſayes of our ſalvation, that it is <hi>not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God:</hi> ſo ſay I of like-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<note place="margin">2 Epheſ. 8.</note> that it is not of our ſelves, it is not of our planting, but a graft implanted in our natures by the hand of God; for we are all naturally (as <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> ſaid of his firſt-born <hi>Reuben) unſtable as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 4.</note>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:120107:71"/>
(i. e.) of a wavering and unſetled temper, of ſcattered and divided ſpirits, (as to worldly things, ſo alſo to religious duties:) which makes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David</hi> pray <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. at the 11 verſe, that God would <hi>unite</hi> his <hi>heart to fear</hi> his <hi>name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Efficient is deſcribed here by the two attributes of patience and conſolation.</p>
            <p>2. But why is he not call'd here the God of faith and hope, as well as of patience and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>R. Either becauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> would ſuit the attributes he gives to God according to the ſenſe of their loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as having by their diviſions ſenſibly loſt much of that patience and comfort which they receiv'd by Chriſt; or elſe becauſe he would mind them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have recourſe for the recovery of their loſſes, and that is to God, who is a full ſtore-houſe of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and conſolation: for the ſtrong were not patient towards the weak, nor the weak to the ſtrong; which was the cauſe of ſuch animoſities and heart-burnings among them, as did much waſt and conſume their ſpirituall joyes and comforts.</p>
            <p>And now if God be the Authour of Unity and like-mindedneſſe, it will then eaſily follow, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than is the authour of diſunity and diviſion; and you may know him (ſay the common people) by his cloven foot, which is the Emblem of diviſion. And if they be Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren<note place="margin">Si Dei vocantur filii qui unitatem colunt, procul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubio Satanae ſunt, qui pacem confundunt. <hi>Greg.</hi> in Paſtor.</note> that love unity; who can think otherwiſe, but that they are Sathans brats that love diviſion?</p>
            <p>3. The reſtriction of the duty; and this is, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chriſt. Nam bene addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, ſecundum Ieſum Chriſtum</hi>

            <p>And this condemns that boundleſſe liberty of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that ſome are ſo eager after in theſe dayes.</p>
            <p>For if it be ſo, that a child of God hath a liberty (as they ſay) in the Doctrines of faith purchaſed for him by Chriſt, to what end then doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> here pray, that the ſtrong and weak <hi>Romans</hi> be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded?

Now different degrees of ſight cannot but cauſe a difference of judgements among Chriſtians. Beſides, the Church of God hath ever had in it ſome babes in Chriſt, ſome <gap reason="foreign">

upon them. And the reaſon of it is this, becauſe every one is ſwayed and biaſsed in his judgement according to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: So that a weakneſſe<note place="margin">Ignorantia veritatis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certam facit labentemque ſententiam. <hi>Lactant.</hi> in Inſtit.

            <p>But yet take this Caveat by the way: That this liberty of ours be not in ſuch things as are clearly and poſitively laid down in Scripture as eſſentialls of Faith and Worſhip.

            <p>It is true indeed that Chriſt hath purchaſed for us a liberty by his death, not onely from the ceremoniall,<note place="margin">Si liberet vos filius, vere eritis liberi. <hi>Ioh. 8. 36.</hi>
